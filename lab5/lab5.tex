\section{TotalView}
We only used TotalView once in lab 4 to detect an error causing the program to
crash. Before we tried TotalView we used print statements to try to locate the
error but we could not find it. With TotalView we could see at what line the
program crashed and which process caused the crash. It has a good user interface
but since it has so many features and settings it can be difficult to find the
correct ones. When we tried to use more than one node with TotalView is tried to
connect to the other nodes but never succeeded to do so.

We were unable to reproduce the error after fixing it so we do not have any
screenshots.

If we compare TotalView to gdb it is easier to get an overview with TotalView
due to the graphical interface. It is a bit tricky to get gdb to work with
multiple processes whereas TotalView is built for that.
